        quote: "There were more than fifty people camped on the Col that night, huddled in shelters pitched side by side, yet an odd feeling of isolation hung in the air. The roar of the wind made it impossible to communicate from one tent to the next. \n\nIn this godforsaken place, I felt disconnected from the climbers around me—emotionally, spiritually, physically—to a degree I hadn’t experienced on any previous expedition. \n\n<We were a team in name only, I’d sadly come to realize.> Although in a few hours we would leave camp as a group, we would ascend as individuals, linked to one another by neither rope nor any deep sense of loyalty. Each client was in it for himself or herself, pretty much. And I was no different: I sincerely hoped Doug got to the top, for instance, yet I would do everything in my power to keep pushing on if he turned around.",

What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder.>\n\n And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.",

And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart. That's how it is with us. <It's a shame, Kath, because we've loved each other all our lives. But in the end, we can't stay together forever.>",

Tony and Shawn had left the mountain, but he’d left to do what my father had taught them to do: drive semis, weld, scrap. \n\n <Tyler stepped into a void. I don’t know why he did it and neither does he. He can’t explain where the conviction came from, or how it burned brightly enough to shine through the black uncertainty.>\n\n But I’ve always supposed it was the music in his head, some hopefully tune the rest of us couldn’t hear, the same secret melody he’d been humming when he bought that trigonometry book, or saved all those pencil shavings.

And broadly speaking, corn-pone stand for self-approval. Self-approval is acquired mainly from the approval of other people. \n\nThe result is conformity. Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest – the bread-and-butter interest- but not in most cases, I think. I think that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated; that it is born of the human being’s natural yearning to stand well with his fellows and have strong and so insistent that it cannot be effectually resisted, and must have its way.",
